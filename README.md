<h2>Snake Game</h2>
<p>Designed and developed the logic for a fully functional snake game with the ability to calculate time from scratch. This involved implementing the game mechanics, designing the user interface, and creating the necessary functions to handle user input and game logic. Additionally, I implemented a time calculation feature to track game duration. Through this project, I gained experience in software development, game design, and problem-solving.</p>
